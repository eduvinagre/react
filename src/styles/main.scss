// Import variables and mixins first so they are available globally
@import 'variables';
@import 'mixins';

// Base styles (resets, body, typography)
@import 'base';

// Import component-specific styles (these are SCSS modules, actual import in components)
// This file is mainly for global styles if you had any, or to ensure build order if not using modules for everything.
// For this setup, component styles are imported directly in their respective .tsx files as CSS Modules.
// You could also have global styles for components here if you weren't using CSS Modules for everything.

// Example:
// @import 'components/button'; // if you had a global button style
